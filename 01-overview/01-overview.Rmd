# An aside: about the structure of these slides

- The course's slide decks are created using the [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#44) (/ʃæ.'riŋ.ɡæn/) R package and [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

- Some slides include hidden comments. To view them, press __p__ on your keyboard

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}

# Prerequisites

- Advanced course in econometrics.


- Some early experience with R (or another programming language) are a plus.

.big[__About__]

How and when to apply ML methods in economics

  - estimate treatment effects.
  - prediction policy.
  - work with new types of data (e.g., text).

To do that we will need to understand

  - what is ML?
  - how it relates to stuff you already know?
  - how it differs?

]

.pull-right[

.big[__Not about__]

- Cutting-edge ML techniques (e.g., generative AI)

- Computational aspects (e.g., gradient descent)

- Data wrangling (a.k.a. "feature engineering")

- Distributed file systems (e.g., Hadoop, Spark)

# Programming


* Two of the most popular open-source programming languages for data science:  

  - [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org/)  
  
  - [<i class="fab fa-python"></i> Python](https://www.python.org/)  

* This course: Mostly R.  

* Why R? See presentation notes and the [FAQ section](https://ml4econ.github.io/course-spring2019/faq.html) of our class website.  

*  We do encourage you to try out Python. However, I will only be able to provide limited support for Python users. Inbar on the other hand, will be able to provide more support.

# Catching up with R

[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) is a great tool to learn R.

[Posit Recipes](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes) is a great (old school) resource to learn R.

# Econometrics with R

```{r introR, echo=FALSE, out.width = "25%", fig.align='center'}

# Large Language Models (LLMs)

We encourage you to use [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), [Claude](https://claude.ai/), or any other LLM in this course, as it is an **essential skill to acquire**.

It is important you understand the (current) limitations of LLMs:

- Prompt engineering is necessary for quality outcomes.
- Always assume that it is wrong.
- Acknowledge its use in assignments and explain what prompts were used.


Three useful resources:

- Follow [@emollick](https://twitter.com/emollick) (Ethan Mollick)
- Read ["Generative AI for Economic Research: Use Cases and Implications for Economists"](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20231736) by Korinek (2023 JEL).


**Share your discoveries with us and your classmates!**

# Grading

Assignments:

- Submit 4 out of a total of 6 Problem sets.


Two projects: 

- Kaggle prediction competition.

- Conduct a replication study based on one of the datasets included in the [experimentdatar](https://itamarcaspi.github.io/experimentdatar/) package, or a paper of your choice.

.center[
__GRADING:__ Assingments __20%__, kaggle __30%__, project __50%__.
]

???

* One of your tasks in this course will be a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) competition. In this competition, you will rely on the “Boston Housing Data” to train and test machine learning models learned in the course. In particular, you will be required to apply the tools introduced in the course in order to predict ... [website](https://www.kaggle.com/t/97eb0edcbe7c406882c7c067076bedd3).

# experimentdatar

We will also  make use of he [`experimentdatar`](https://itamarcaspi.github.io/experimentdatar/) data package that contains publicly available datasets that were used in Susan Athey and Guido Imbens' course ["Machine Learning and Econometrics"](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/cont-ed/2018-webcasts) (AEA continuing Education, 2018).

- You can install the **development** version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/itamarcaspi/experimentdatar/)
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("itamarcaspi/experimentdatar")
```

- __EXAMPLE:__ Load the [`experimentdatar`](https://itamarcaspi.github.io/experimentdatar/) package and the `social` dataset:
```r
library(experimentdatar)
data(social)  
```
- Tips:  
  1. Runnig `?social` privides variable definitions.
  2. Running `dataDetails("social")` will open a link to the paper associated with `social`.
