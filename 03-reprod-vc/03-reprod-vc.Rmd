# RStudio Projects


---

# Reproducibility

- **Reproducible research:** Enables others to replicate your results

- **Project requirements:**
  - Document your work (code and explanations)
  - List used packages (including version numbers)
  - Detail your R environment (R version, OS, etc.)
  
- **Reproducible mindset:** Focus on code consumers, including your future self


---

# An Aside: `renv`

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://rstudio.github.io/renv/logo.svg")
```
]

.pull-right[

- **[`renv` package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html):** Create reproducible environments for R projects

- **Key benefits:**

  - *Isolated:* Private package library for each project
  - *Portable:* Easily transfer projects across computers and platforms
  - *Reproducible:* Records exact package versions for consistent installations
  
- **Learn more:** [Introduction to `renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)

# RStudio Project Oriented Workflow


- **Avoid `setwd()` and `rm(list=ls())`:** [Improper R script practices](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)

- **Recommended alternatives:**

  1. Utilize RStudio's project environment
  
  2. Modify settings:
     - Go to `Tools -> Global Options -> General`
     - Set "Save workspace to .RData on exit" to **NEVER**



---

# R Markdown


- **R Markdown notebooks:** Premier tool for reproducible research in R

- **Knitting process:** Starts with a clean slate

- **R Markdown file:** Integrates text, code, links, figures, tables, etc.

- **Ideal for communication:** Export .Rmd file as:
  - Document (Word, PDF, HTML, Markdown)
  - Presentation (HTML, Beamer, Xaringan, PowerPoint)
  - Website ([`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/))
  - Book ([`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/home/))
  - Journal article ([`pagedown`](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown))
  - Dashboard ([`flexdashboards`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/))

# This is Not a Pipe

```{r pipe, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("figs/pipe.jpg")

```


---

# Prerequisite: `%>%` is a pipe

- **Pipe operator `%>%`:** From [`magrittr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html) package, integral to `tidyverse`

- **Understanding `%>%`:** Associate it with "then"

- **Example:**
  - Traditional: `y <- h(g(f(x), z))`
  
  - With pipe: `y <- x %>% f() %>% g(z) %>% h()`
  
  - Read as: Take `x`, _then_ apply `f()`, _then_ apply `g(. , z)`, _then_ apply `h()`, and store result in `y`

# Morning Routine

```{r pipe2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}

```

# Base R vs. the Tidyverse

- Consider the following data frame:
```{r }
df <- data.frame(
        x = rnorm(10),
        y = rnorm(10),
        z = rnorm(10)
      )
```

- Can you guess what the following code chunk does?
```{r }
df_new <- df[df$x > 0, c("x", "y")]
df_new$xx <- df_new$x^2
```

--



---

# "Pipped" code?

- How about this one?

```{r }
df_new <- df %>% 
  select(x, y) %>% 
  filter(x > 0) %>% 
  mutate(xx = x^2)
```


The above code chunk should be read as:

>"generate a new dataframe `df_new` by taking `df`, _then_ select `x` and `y`, _then_ filter rows where `x` is positive, _then_ mutate a new variable `xx = x^2`"

# Enter ChatGPT...

```{r chat, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/chat_dplyr.png")
```


---

# Even better

```{r chat2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "45%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/chat_dplyr2.png")
```


---

# Pros & cons

- Following a "tidy" approach makes your code more readable $\Rightarrow$ more reproducible.

- I believe that there is a growing consensus in the #rstats community that we should [learn the tidyverse first](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/).

- Nevertheless, note that the tidyverse is "Utopian" in the sense that it strives toward _perfection_, and thus keeps changing. By contrast, base R was built to last.

- As usual, being proficient in both (base R and the tidyverse) will get you far...

# The Tidyverse

```{r tidyverse_pic, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("figs/tidyverse.png")

```

---

# Tidyverse Packages

Which packages come with `tidyverse`?

```{r }

tidyverse_packages()

```

Note that not all these packages are loaded by default.

We now briefly introduce the tidyverse's flagship: `dplyr`.

---

# `dplyr`: The grammar of data manipulation

- **`dplyr`:** Essential tool for data manipulation

- **Key verbs:**
  - `filter()` - Select observations (rows)
  - `select()` - Select variables (columns)
  - `mutate()` - Generate new variables (columns)
  - `arrange()` - Sort observations (rows)
  - `summarise()` - Summary statistics (by groups)
  
- **Some additional verbs:**
  - `group_by()` - Group observations by variables
  - `sample_n()` - Sample rows from a table
  
- **Learn more:** [`dplyr` documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html)



---

# The `tidymodels` package

- Tidymodels extends the tidyverse's "grammar" philosophy to modeling tasks.

```{r tidymodels}
tidymodels::tidymodels_packages()
```


For more information, visit the [tidymodels GitHub repo](https://github.com/tidymodels/tidymodels).

- GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control that uses Git.

- It can be thought of as "Dropbox" for Git projects, offering advanced features beyond basic version control.

- GitHub is a popular platform for developing open-source projects, including popular R packages and other software libraries.

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a user-friendly graphical interface that allows developers to interact with Git repositories.

- It provides an intuitive way to manage changes to code, create and switch branches, and synchronize local and remote repositories.

- GitHub Desktop also simplifies collaboration by making it easy to create and review pull requests, resolve merge conflicts, and manage code reviews.
